## üöÄ Live Demo

*   **Frontend (Vercel):** [https://mohamedazimal.vercel.app](https://mohamedazimal.vercel.app)
*   **Backend (Render):** The backend is live and serves the frontend. You can access its root endpoint to see a status message. *(Note: You will need to provide the user with the actual Render URL if you want them to be able to access it directly)*
